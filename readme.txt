Show video thumbnails or playable blocks of recent videos from YouTube Playlist, Channel (User Uploads), Liked or Favourited videos.

== Description ==

When you need to display sidebar widget with latest or random video from some YouTube channel or playlist, use plugin **YouTube Channel**!

Simply insert widget to sidebar or shortcode to content, set Channel or Playlist ID, select resource to use and if you wish leave all other options on default. You will get latest video from chosen YouTube channel or playlist embedded on location of widget/shortcode, with optional link to channel at the bottom of the YTC block.

If you like our plugin and you find it useful, please [write review and rate it](https://wordpress.org/support/view/plugin-reviews/youtube-channel).

For manual set of videos from YouTube check out [Easy YouTube Gallery](https://wordpress.org/plugins/easy-youtube-gallery/).

= Features =
* Display latest videos from YouTube Channel (resources are sorted in reverse chronological order based on the date they were created) or videos naturaly sorted from Favorited Videos, Liked Videos and Playlist
* Option to get random video from any of 4 resources
* Responsive (one full width video per row) or non responsive
* Preferred aspect ratio relative to width (16:9 and 4:3)
* Custom width for video embeded object (default is 306px)
* Enhanced Privacy
* Choose to display video as thumbnail (default), HTML5 (iframe) or HTML5 Asynchronous (iframe2)
* Thumbnail mode opens video in lightbox
* Custom feed caching timeout
* Optional video autoplay with optional muted audio
* Optional TinyMCE button on post/page edit (can be disabled on General plugin settings page)
* Show customized link to channel/vanity/legacy username below videos
* Final look is highly customizable thanks to predefined classes for each element of YTC block!

= Requirements =

For fully functional plugin you need to have PHP 5.3 or newer! If you experience issues on older PHP, we can't help you as we don't have access to such old development platform.

If you have an old version of WordPress bundled with jQuery library older than v1.7, some aspects of plugin may not work, as we do not reinclude jQuery library.

= Styling =

You can use `style.css` from theme or other custom location to additionaly style/tweak look of YTC block. You can stick to classes:

* `.widget_youtube-channel` – class of whole widget (parent for widget title and YTC block)
* `.youtube_channel` – YTC block wrapper class. Additional classes are available:
  * `.default` – for non-responsive block
  * `.responsive` – when you have enabled responsive option
* `.ytc_title` – class of H3 tag for video title above thumbnail/video object
  * `.ytc_title_above` - additional class for video title above video/thumbnail
  * `.ytc_title_below` - additional class for video title below video/thumbnail
* `.ytc_video_container` – class of container for single item, plus:
  * `.ytc_video_1`, `.ytc_video_2`, … – class of container for single item with ordering number of item in widget
  * `.ytc_video_first` – class of first container for single item
  * `.ytc_video_mid` – class of all other containers for single item
  * `.ytc_video_last` – class of last container for single item
  * `.ar16_9` – class for Aspect Ratio 16:9
  * `.ar4_3` – class for Aspect Ration 4:3
* `.ytc_thumb` – class of anchor for Thumbnail mode
* `.fluid-width-video-wrapper` – class for parent element of IFRAME for enabled responsive
* `.ytc_description` – class for video description text below thumbnail/video object
* `.ytc_link` – class of container for link to channel

= Known Issues =

* Video title and description for embedded playlist mode does not work.
* Removing YouTube logo from playback control bar does not work for all videos
* Async HTML5 video does not work for 2nd same video on same page (two YTC blocks set to Async HTML5)

If WordFence or other malware scan tool detect YouTube Channel fule youtube-channel.php as potential risk because `base64_encode()` and `base64_decode()` functions, remember that we use this two functions to store and restore JSON feeds to transient cache, so potential detection is false positive.

= YouTube Data API Key =
Main difference since v2.x branch is that now we use [YouTube Data API v3](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/) so to make plugin to work, you'll need to generate YouTube Data API Key and insert it to General plugin settings.

Learn more about [Obtaining authorization credentials](https://developers.google.com/youtube/registering_an_application) and for detailed instructions how to generate your own API Key watch video below.

[youtube http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NlXV77QO8U]

1. Visit [Google Developers Console](https://console.developers.google.com/project).
1. If you don't have any project, create new one. Name it so you can recognize it (for example **My WordPress Website**).
1. Select your new project and from LHS sidebar expand group **APIs & auth**, then select item **APIs**.
1. Locate and click **YouTube Data API** under **YouTube API** section.
1. Click **Enable API** button.
1. When you get enabled YouTube Data API in your project, click **Credentials** item from LHS menu **APIs & auth**.
1. Click **Create New Key** button and select **Server Key**.
1. Leave empty or enter IP of your website. If you get message **Oops, something went wrong.** make sure you set proper IP, or do not set any restriction.
1. Click **Create** button.
1. Copy newly created **API Key**.

When you generate your own YouTube Data API Key, from your **Dashboard** go to **Settings** -> **YouTube Channel** -> **General** and paster key in to field **YouTube Data API Key**.

Also, do not forget to check and update **Channel ID** in plugin's General settings, Widgets and/or shortcodes.
You can get **Channel ID** from page [Account Advanced](https://www.youtube.com/account_advanced) while you're loagged in to your YouTube account.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

Please note, latest FAQ you can find [on our website](http://urosevic.net/wordpress/plugins/youtube-channel/faq/). This section on WordPress.org has been updated only on plugin version release, so questions answered between releases are not visible here.

= How to get that YouTube Data API Key? =

Please folllow [Installation](https://wordpress.org/plugins/youtube-channel/installation/) instructions.

= I set everything correct but receiveing 'Oops, something went wrong' message =

Login as user with Administrator role and you'll see YTC ERROR message with explanation what's wrong. Examples:

> **YTC ERROR:** Please check did you set proper Channel ID. You set to show videos from channel, but YouTube does not recognize MyCoolLegacyName as existing and public channel.

Do exactly what message says - check and correct Channel ID in default settings/widget/shortcode.

> **YTC ERROR** Check YouTube Data API Key restrictions, empty cache if enabled by appending in browser address bar parameter ?ytc_force_recache=1

1. Try to remove restrictions by referer or IP in your **YouTube Data API Key** and refresh page after couple minutes.
1. If that does not help, please try to create new API Key for Server w/o restrictions (not to regenerate existing one).

= How to use Google APIs Explorer to verify YouTube feeds? =

If there is no `YTC ERROR` code in HTML source, visit [Google API Explorer](https://developers.google.com/apis-explorer/#p/youtube/v3/youtube.playlistItems.list?part=snippet&maxResults=5&playlistId=) and append to the end of URL one of resource ID’s based on your Channel ID:

* for videos from channel replace **UC** with **UU** in Channel ID (so *UCRPqmcpGcJ_gFtTmN_a4aVA* becomes *UURPqmcpGcJ_gFtTmN_a4aVA*)
* for videos from Favourited videos replace **UC** with **FL** (so *UCRPqmcpGcJ_gFtTmN_a4aVA* becomes *FLRPqmcpGcJ_gFtTmN_a4aVA*)
* for videos from Liked Videos replace **UC** with **LL** (so *UCRPqmcpGcJ_gFtTmN_a4aVA* becomes *LLRPqmcpGcJ_gFtTmN_a4aVA*)
* for videos from Playlist simply use Playlist ID (like *PLEC850BE962234400* or *RDMMjUe8uoKdHao*)

Note that all four resources are *playlists* (including uploads to channel), so append mentioned ID to field **playlistId** (not to **id**), and click **Execute** button at the bottom of that page.

1. If you receive some error in results, tune parameters in APIs Explorer.
1. If there is no error but you do not get any video in results, and you are sure that there is public videos in selected resource – contact Google Support.
1. If there are video results but not displayed with YouTube Channel plugin – check topic [Read before you post support question or report bug](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/ytc3-read-before-you-post-support-question-or-report-bug) and then [start your own support topic](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/youtube-channel#postform).

= What this YTC ERROR/HTTP Error means? =

You will be able to reproduce HTTP Error w/o WordPress if you have SSH access to server where you host your website. Simply login to shell and run following command:

`curl https://www.googleapis.com/youtube/v3/playlistItems`

If you do not receive response like one below, then you'll receive HTTP Error from curl command.

`{
 "error": {
  "errors": [
   {
    "domain": "global",
    "reason": "required",
    "message": "Required parameter: part",
    "locationType": "parameter",
    "location": "part"
   }
  ],
  "code": 400,
  "message": "Required parameter: part"
 }
}`

Known HTTP Errors:

**error:0D0890A1:asn1 encoding routines:ASN1_verify:unknown message digest algorithm**

The remote connection software you are using on your server might be compiled with a very old version of OpenSSL that does not take certificates signed with sha256-With-RSA-Encryption into account. It requires at least OpenSSL 0.9.8o for a total management of SHA256.

Please contact your server admin or hosting provider about this issue.

**Problem with the SSL CA cert (path? access rights?)**

This is a server related issue (not related to YouTube Channel or WordPress).

To resolve the issue, you’ll need to restart Apache (or nginx). If that doesn’t fix the problem, you’ll need to restart your entire server. Or simply contact server support.

= Where to find correct Channel ID and/or Vanity custom Name? =

Login to your YouTube account and visit page [Account Advanced](https://www.youtube.com/account_advanced).

You'll find your **Vanity Name** as "Your custom URL" in **Channel settins** section on that page. For YTC plugin use only part **after www.youtube.com/c/**, not full URL.

**Channel ID** is **YouTube Channel ID** value composed of mixed characters starting with **UC**.

= Where to find ID for Favourites and/or Liked Videos? =

You will not need that two ID's, in general. But, if you really wish to know, these two ID's are produced from your **Channel ID**. Channel ID start with **UC** (like `UCRPqmcpGcJ_gFtTmN_a4aVA`)

* For Favourites ID replace **UC** with **FL** (so you get `FLRPqmcpGcJ_gFtTmN_a4aVA`)
* For Liked Videos ID replace **UC** with **LL** (so you get `LLRPqmcpGcJ_gFtTmN_a4aVA`)

= What is Vanity custom URL? =

Check out [Channel custom URL](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2657968?ref_topic=3024172&hl=en-GB) article.

= Where to find Playlist ID? =

Playlist ID can be manually extracted from YouTube playlist URL. Just look for string after `&list=` parameter in URL which can contain lowercase and uppercase letters, dash and underscore characters. Regular playlists starts with uppercase letters **PL** (like *PLEC850BE962234400*), but Playlist ID for YouTube mixes start with uppercase **RD** (like *RDCfMMlT8Lyns*).

= Video titles missing after plugin update =

If you inserted videos by shortcode previous v3.0.8 then you probably have set parameter `showtitle=1`.

Since version v3.0.8 of plugin this parameter has been changed to accept values `none`, `above` and `below`, depending do you wish to hide video title, or to display them above/below video thumbnail.

So, you can:
1. Remove `showtitle` parameter from shortcode and set **Show title** global plugin option on **Content** tab, or
1. Change parameter `showtitle` to `above` or `below`.

= How to force embeding 320p video with better audio quality? =

YouTube provide 320p videos if height of embeded video is set to 320 or more. If you use small YTC video size, 240p will be loaded instead. So, you could not force 720p in tiny YTC.

= I enabled option `Hide YT Logo` but YouTube logo is still visible =

Modestbranding option does not work for all videos, so a lot of videos will still have YouTube logo in control bar. I recommend to enable option `Hide player controls` instead.

Also, even when hidding logo works for your video, on hover or when video is paused in upper right corner will be displayed YouTube link/logo. [Read more here](https://developers.google.com/youtube/player_parameters#modestbranding)

= How I can achieve 'wall' layout with one featured thumbnail? =

You can try with shortcode combination:
`[youtube_channel num=7 responsive=1 class=ytc_wall_1-6 resource=2 random=1]`

and custom CSS code added to theme style.css or similar customization:
`.youtube_channel.ytc_wall_1-6 .ytc_video_container {
    padding: 5px;
    box-sizing: border-box;
    max-width: 33.333%;
}
.youtube_channel.ytc_wall_1-6 .ytc_video_container.ytc_video_1 {
    max-width: 100%;
}
@media screen and (max-width: 768px) {
    .youtube_channel.ytc_wall_1-6 .ytc_video_container:not(.ytc_video_1) {
        max-width: 50%;
    }
}
@media screen and (max-width: 480px) {
    .youtube_channel.ytc_wall_1-6 .ytc_video_container:not(.ytc_video_1) {
        max-width: 100%;
    }
}`

So, we display thumbnails for 7 random videos from default (global) playlist, and distribute small thumbnails to 3 columns on wide screens, 2 columns under 768px and single thumbnail per row under 480px.


= How to reduce size of/remove thumbnail Play button? =

Since v3.0.8 we changed how thumnail Play button is embedded. If you wish to reduce button size, tune transform CSS property in theme's style.css, like this:
`.youtube_channel .ytc_thumb>span:before {
  transform: scale(.65);
}`

If you wish to remove (hide) play button from thumbnails, simply set display property to none, like this:

`.youtube_channel .ytc_thumb>span:before {
  display: none !important;
}`

= Your plugin does not support *THIS* or *THAT* =

If you really need that missing feature ASAP, feel free to [contact me](urosevic.net/wordpress/contact/). Select *Subject* option "Quote For New Feature in YouTube Channel", provide detailed explanation of feature you need, also provide some example if there is such, and I'll send you price for implementation.

If you don't wish to pay for enhancements (then you don't care would that be implemented in a week, month, year or so), then send new [Support topic](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/youtube-channel) with *Topic title* in format **[Feature Request] ...**
