Show video thumbnails or playable blocks of recent videos from YouTube Channel or Playlist.

== Description ==

When you need to display sidebar widget with latest video from some YouTube channel or playlist, you can use customisable `YouTube Channel` plugin.

Simply insert widget to sidebar, set channel name and if you wish leave all other options on default. You will get latest video from chosen YouTube channel embedded in sidebar widget, with link to channel on the bottom of the widget. If you wish to use playlist instead of channel, just set playlist ID and injoy!

If you like this extension and you find it useful, please rate it on the right side.

= Styling =
You can use `style.css` from theme to style `YouTube Video` widget content.

* `.youtube_channel` - widget wrapper class
* `.ytc_title` - class of video title abowe thumbnail/video object
* `.ytc_video_container` - class of container for single item
* `.ytc_video_1`, `.ytc_video_2`, ... - class of container for single item with ordering number of item in widget
* `.ytc_video_first` - class of first container for single item
* `.ytc_video_last` - class of last container for single item
* `.ytc_video_mid` - class of all other containers for single item 
* `.ytc_description` - class for video description text
* `.ytc_link` - class of container for link to channel

= Issues =
Controls light theme and hidden annotations does not work for chromeless object.
Video description for videos from playlist does nt work.

If WordFence or other malware scan tool detect YouTube Channel fule youtube-channel.php as potential risk because `base64_encode()` and `base64_decode()` functions, remember that we use this two functions to store and restore JSON feeds to transient cache, so potential detection is false positive.

== Installation ==

You can use the built in installer and upgrader, or you can install the plugin manually.

1. You can either use the automatic plugin installer or your FTP program to upload unziped `youtube-channel` directory to your `wp-content/plugins` directory.
2. Activate the plugin through the `Plugins` menu in WordPress
3. Add YouTube Channel widget to sidebar
4. Set channel name and save changes

If you have to upgrade manually simply repeat the installation steps and re-enable the plugin.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= I set more than one items to fetch, but only one video is displayed. How to fix this? =

Below option `Fetch ... video(s)` you can find `Show ... video(s)` since version 2.0.0. Here you can set number of videos to display.

= How to get playlist ID? =

Playlist ID can be manualy extracted from YouTube playlist URL. Part of strings after `&list=` that begins with uppercase letters `PL` represent playlist ID. You can paste ID with or without leading `PL` string.

Since version 1.3.1 you can also paste full YouTube playlist URL and ID will be automaticaly extracted.

= How to force embeding 320p video with better audio quality? =

YouTube provide 320p videos if height of embeded video is set to 320 or more. If you use small YTC video size, 240p will be loaded instead. So, you could not force 720p in tiny YTC.

= What is a difference between `Fetch latest` and `Show ... videos`? =

Value for `Fetch latest` says how many items will containt videos feed for choosing random video.
Value for `Show ... videos` says how many videos will be displayed in widget.

= In wich way does the plugin order the videos? Not by the time they were uploaded... =

By default, YTC sort videos by publishing date/time, not by uploaded date/time.

If you have enabled option `Fix No items error/Respect playlist order`, then videos are not sorted by publishing date, but by YouTube default order.

= When I upload a new video at youtube, it is not in the list at my site =

Video feed for YTC has been retreived with standard youtube feed [uploads by specified user](https://developers.google.com/youtube/2.0/developers_guide_protocol?hl=en#User_Uploaded_Videos "User Uploaded Videos"), and as Google say: [uploaded videos will be included in a user's public uploaded videos feed a few minutes after the upload completes and YouTube finishes processing the video](https://developers.google.com/youtube/2.0/reference#Latency_Information).

If you does not see your latest video in your uplaods feed (which you can access at https://gdata.youtube.com/feeds/api/users/YOUR_YT_USERID/uploads by replacing YOUR_YT_USERID with your real youtube user ID), then YTC will not see it too.
