Simply insert widget to sidebar, set channel name and if you wish leave all other options on default.

== Installation ==

You can use the built in installer and upgrader, or you can install the plugin manually.

1. You can either use the automatic plugin installer or your FTP program to upload unziped `youtube-channel` directory to your `wp-content/plugins` directory.
2. Activate the plugin through the `Plugins` menu in WordPress
3. Add YouTube Channel widget to your sidebar
4. Set channel name and save changes

If you have to upgrade manually simply repeat the installation steps and re-enable the plugin.

== TODO ==

* Add option to open video for thumbnail image in lightbox

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= I set more than one items to fetch, but only one video is displayed. How to fix this? =

Below option `Fetch ... video(s)` you can find `Show ... video(s)` since version 2.0.0. Here you can set number of videos to display.

= How to get playlist ID? =

Playlist ID can be manualy extracted from YouTube playlist URL. Part of strings after `&list=` that begins with uppercase letters `PL` represent playlist ID. You can paste ID with or without leading `PL` string.

Since version 1.3.1 you can also paste full YouTube playlist URL and ID will be automaticaly extracted.

= How to force embeding 320p video with better audio quality? =

YouTube provide 320p videos if height of embeded video is set to 320 or more. If you use small YTC video size, 240p will be loaded instead. So, you could not force 720p in tiny YTC.

= What is a difference between `Fetch latest` and `Show ... videos`? =

Value for `Fetch latest` says how many items will containt videos feed for choosing random video.
Value for `Show ... videos` says how many videos will be displayed in widget.

= In wich way does the plugin order the videos? Not by the time they were uploaded... =

By default, YTC sort videos by publishing date/time, not by uploaded date/time.

If you have enabled option `Fix No items error/Respect playlist order`, then videos are not sorted by publishing date, but by YouTube default order.

= When I upload a new video at youtube, it is not in the list at my site =

Video feed for YTC has been retreived with standard youtube feed [uploads by specified user](https://developers.google.com/youtube/2.0/developers_guide_protocol?hl=en#User_Uploaded_Videos "User Uploaded Videos"), and as Google say: [uploaded videos will be included in a user's public uploaded videos feed a few minutes after the upload completes and YouTube finishes processing the video](https://developers.google.com/youtube/2.0/reference#Latency_Information).

If you does not see your latest video in your uplaods feed (which you can access at https://gdata.youtube.com/feeds/api/users/YOUR_YT_USERID/uploads by replacing YOUR_YT_USERID with your real youtube user ID), then YTC will not see it too.
