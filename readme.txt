Simply insert widget to sidebar, set channel name and if you wish leave all other options on default.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why yet another YouTube widget extension? =

I could not to find widget with link to channel and thumbnail instead of video object, so I made this one.

= I set more thano one items to fetch, but only one video is displayed. How to fix this? =

Currently YTC can display only one video per time. Option `Items to fetch` us used for calculating what random video from channel or playlist to get as limit of videos of which random is calculated.

= How to get playlist ID? =

Playlist ID can be manualy extracted from YouTube playlist URL. Part of strings after `&list=` that begins with uppercase letters `PL` represent playlist ID. You can paste ID with or without leading `PL` string.

Since version 1.3.1 you can paste full YouTube playlist URL and ID will be automaticaly extracted.

= How to force embeding 320p video with better audio quality? =

YouTube provide 320p videos if height of embeded video is set to 320 or more. If you use small YTC video size, 240p will be loaded instead.

= There is two playlist checkboxes, how they works? =

If you wish to use videos from playlist instead of videos from channel (display random videos, one or more videos, with all kind of settings) enable option `Use the playlist instead of channel`.
If you wish to show only single embedded playlist block using IFRAME (HTML5), then enable option `Embed only standard playlist` and all other settings will be ignored.

= What is a difference between `Fetch latest` and `Show ... videos`? =

Value for `Fetch latest` says how many items will containt set of videos for choosing random video.
value for `Show ... videos` says how many videos will be displayed in widget.
